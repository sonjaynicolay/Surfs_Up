## 1.	Overview:


After a dreamy visit to Hawaii, a business plan is initialized. The business plan calls for a Surf and Ice Cream Shop. For expert advice we consult with W. Avy, professional surfer. The main concerns for running a successful/profitable shop are the weatheron the island of Oahu in Hawaii. This analysis overviews the weather particularly in the months of June and December on the island of Oahu.


## Results:

•	The Average Temperatures
  The Average temperature in June at 75 vs December being 71, is a bit concerning. 
  
•	Minimum Temperature Difference
  June shows a minimum temperature of 64 degrees but December shows a low of 56 degrees. 
  
•	Count Difference
  The data we compiled our analysis from is not based on the same amount of recorded temperatures in June versus December. The count was 1700 for June and for December it was only   1517. June has 30 days and December has 31. The difference in days does not make up the data gap.

## 2. Summary:
After reviewing the results, there are more concerns than relief. With the differnece of the average temps being less than 4 degrees different from June to December more weather analysis is needed. Summary Statastics should be found for the all of the Summer months, June-September. Once those are found average rainfall during the rainy season as well as the occurence of any severe weather during hurricane season, as Oahu is an island in the Pacific Ocean and is suceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms. Based on the temperatures returned it would be ideal to also analyze other aspects that affect the business. 

I believe more research should be completed in regards to consumer ice cream buying habits based on weather and at the beach. I also believe that average water temps should be part of the research. If water temps are cool and average temps are mild, ice cream may not be the best item to sell at the beach.
